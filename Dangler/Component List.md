## 1. Time Tile (TT):  
Tiles will be most base / foundational part of the application.  
Ex. 
Google maps: google maps uses the algorith called map tiling.  
Google Maps uses a large database of map images, called "map tiles", to create the map you see on your screen. Each map tile represents a small portion of the map at a specific zoom level, and the map tiles are seamlessly stitched together to create the map.
When you zoom in or out on Google Maps, the map tiles are dynamically loaded and displayed at the appropriate zoom level.  
Must have features: `Zooming`, `Panning`

Similarly our project will time tiles which we loosely stitches together, each TT will represent the small portiom of an eraat the specific zoom level. when we zoom in or out on Dangler, the map tiles are dynamically loaded and displayer at the appropriate zoom level.  

## 2. Pipe:  
A pipe to define the linear flow of person, things lifespan.  

## 3. knots:  
knots that represents the major stories about the indivuals.
